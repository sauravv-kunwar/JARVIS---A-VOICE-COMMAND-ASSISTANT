# JARVIS---A-VOICE-COMMAND-ASSISTANT

Jarvis is a simple yet powerful voice-controlled assistant built with Python. It can recognize your voice commands, speak back to you, and perform actions like opening popular websites or playing songs from a custom music library.

This project is a great way to explore speech recognition, text-to-speech, and real-time interactivity using Python.

📦 Why Use a Virtual Environment?
Using a virtual environment helps keep your project isolated from other Python projects on your system. It ensures:

Clean dependency management

No conflicts between package versions

Easy setup and teardown of your development environment
